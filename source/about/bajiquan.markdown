[Bājíquán](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B%C4%81j%C3%ADqu%C3%A1n) is a northern Chinese martial art which emphasizes a short-range fighting style and the ability to generate a great deal of power over small distances. It was developed originally in the Hebei area of China amongst the Muslim [Hui](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hui_people) people. The lineage I practiced was the Li family lineage, through [Li Shuwen](http://www.satirio.com/ma/baji/lineage.html).
