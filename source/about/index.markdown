My name is Jack Lund. I'm a software architect and programmer working in the 'burbs North of Chicago. I'm one of the co-founders of a company called [M2M Connections, Inc](http://www.m2mconnectionsinc.com). We do all sorts of things relating small devices to cloud systems.

When I'm not working (which isn't all that often), I'm either spending time with my wife and twin daughters, or practicing [Eskrima](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eskrima) with my teacher, [Guro Edie Mesina](http://www.lionsmartialarts.com/instructors/guro-edie-mesina.html).
