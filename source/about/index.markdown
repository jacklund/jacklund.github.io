My name is Jack Lund, and I'm a software developer/architect/all-around geek, currently living in the northern suburbs of Chicago with my lovely (and very patient) wife, and twin daughters. I'm currently a cofounder and senior architect at [M2M Connections Inc.](http://www.m2mconnectionsinc.com), a consulting company which specializes in machine-to-machine and cloud-based software.

I've been a [programmer](/about/programming.html) professionally for around 30 years now, and non-professionally a few years before that. I've developed code in C, C++, Java, Perl, Python, and Ruby, and a number of other languages which have fallen by the wayside over the years. I've worked as a software architect in varying capacities for close to 20 years.

I have a very wide variety of non-work interests, including physics (my undergraduate degree) and math, politics, philosophy, music and books. I also am an avid [martial artist](/about/martial-arts.html).

If you wish to contact me, I can be reached at jack.lund [at] geekheads.net.
