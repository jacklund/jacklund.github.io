I've studied various styles of martial arts on and off for pretty much my entire life. I took some Judo as a kid, Tae Kwon Do as a teenager, got my 1st Dan Black Belt in [Cha Yon Ryu](http://www.kimsookarate.com/intro/what-is-cyr.html) with [John Blankenship](http://www.blankenshipmartialarts.com/home.asp) in Austin, Texas when I was in my 30s. Around the same time, I studied [Shuai Jiao](/about/shuai-jiao.html), [Tán Tuǐ](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T%C3%A1n_Tu%C7%90), [Seven-star Praying Mantis](http://www.sevenstarmantis.com/kung-fu.php), and [Bājíquán](/about/bajiquan.html) with [Sifu John Wang](http://www.johnswang.com/) from Austin. During that time I also learned various forms of Taiji, as well as some [Hung Gar](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hung_Ga).

Since then I have studied Boxing and Cabales [Eskrima](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eskrima) with [Waldo Ocaña](http://www.anabasisarts.com/), and am currently studying [Kampilan Eskrima](https://www.facebook.com/pages/Kampilan-Eskrima/129295910435367) with [Guro Edie Mesina](http://www.lionsmartialarts.com/instructors/guro-edie-mesina.html).
