Shuai Jiao is a Chinese throwing art, somewhat like Judo, except with no ground work. [Here](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nM5orlabCFE) is a YouTube video of some good examples of Shuai Jiao throws, from the same lineage I was taught in. The idea is very different than Judo, in that, instead of “gentle” throws, Shuai Jiao throws are designed to inflict as much damage as possible to the person.
