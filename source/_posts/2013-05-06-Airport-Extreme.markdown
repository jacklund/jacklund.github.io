Had to replace my old, crappy Netgear router over the weekend - it was getting flaky, and causing my Skype calls to freak out at inopportune moments. I was thinking about going the [DD-WRT](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DD-WRT) route (if you'll excuse the pun), but it looked like it required more of a time commitment than I am able to manage at the moment. Since almost everything we have in this house is some form of Apple product, I decided to try out the Airport Extreme.

Man, was that thing easy to set up, especially compared to the Living Hell that is most router setups. I just went into Airport Utility on my laptop, it automagically found the router, I configured it right there, and it just frickin' worked! Unbelievable! Admittedly, it's a pricey router, but I think it's worth it with the time it saved me.

It also seems to be a **lot** more powerful than those underpowered Netgear POSes, which is an added benefit.
