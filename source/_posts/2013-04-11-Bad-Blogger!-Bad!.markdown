It's been over a year since I last used [scriptogr.am](http://scriptogr.am). Mostly I haven't had much time to actually post - work has been rather intense, but in a good way. :-)

Recently, I've been looking around for blog solutions, and I keep coming back to this.  I've been getting more and more into using [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/), and [MultiMarkdown](http://fletcherpenney.net/multimarkdown/) for lots of things, from note taking to creating documents. I'll try to put together another post about that sometime soon. However, for blogging, I wanted to use Markdown, so I looked at [jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/), which is what [github pages](http://pages.github.com/) uses, but it kind of requires some work in terms of setting up the templates, css, etc (although there is a [Jekyll Bootstrap](http://jekyllbootstrap.com/) project which helps a lot), and, being the lazy (not to mention busy) guy I am, I decided it was too much work after futzing with it for a couple of hours.

This seems to be the most painless solution, so I'm going with it.

Code blocks seem to be handled relatively well:

    public class Foo {
      private int bar;
      
      public int getBar() {
        return bar;
      }
    }

So, I'll stick with this, for now.
