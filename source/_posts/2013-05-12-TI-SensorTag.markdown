I got my [TI Bluetooth SensorTag](http://processors.wiki.ti.com/index.php/Bluetooth_SensorTag) Friday, and played with it some over the weekend. It's pretty nice. It's basically a small device with a bunch of embedded sensors on it - accelerometer, gyroscope, ambient temp, IR temp (see below), humidity, barometric pressure, and a couple of buttons on it. It's very small, and communicates over [Bluetooth 4 LE](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bluetooth_low_energy). You can download an iOS app for viewing the data, so my daughters and I played with it some. Pretty cool. There's a [teardown of it](http://blog.makezine.com/2013/04/18/teardown-of-the-ti-sensortag) at MAKE magazine, and even a [Raspberry Pi](http://mike.saunby.net/2013/04/raspberry-pi-and-ti-cc2541-sensortag.html) project to interface with it. W00t!!!
