I finally gave up on [scriptogr.am](http://www.scriptogr.am). I was struggling with their syntax highlighting, even sent a message to their support. The only answer I got back was from another user (who was very helpful, but it didn't really fix my problem). So, I'm done.

I'm now using [GitHub Pages](http://pages.github.com/), which generates their pages using [Jekyll](https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll). I'm also using [Octopress](http://octopress.org/) for the layout, which makes it all pretty easy (well, that is, once you go through the somewhat painful ruby setup).
