I wasted a considerable amount of time following the instructions from [this page](http://subclipse.tigris.org/wiki/JavaHL) under OS X trying to get MacPorts to install the right version of Subversion. Turns out it doesn't have it - it's only got 1.7, which won't work with the version of Subclipse I'm using. So, I had to go to [WanDisco](http://www.wandisco.com/subversion/download#osx) and download it (after removing the MacPorts versions first), and then everything worked.
