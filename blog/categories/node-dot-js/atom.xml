    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I was working on trying to get the barometer readings from my <a href="http://www.ti.com/ww/en/wireless_connectivity/sensortag/index.shtml?DCMP=sensortag&amp;HQS=sensortag-bn">TI SensorTag</a> using Node.js when I came across this problem. See, the <a href="http://processors.wiki.ti.com/index.php/SensorTag_User_Guide#Barometric_Pressure_Sensor_2">user&rsquo;s guide</a> has two code examples for the algorithm for the pressure &ndash; one in C, and one in Java. The one in C uses primarily bit shift operations, whereas the one in Java uses <code>Math.pow()</code> to do the same thing. Naturally, I tended towards the bit shift operations since it makes the code a bit clearer as to what it&rsquo;s doing (ultimately, from a performance perspective, it doesn&rsquo;t matter since <code>Math.pow(2, x)</code> probably ultimately resolves to bit shifts anyway).</p>

<p>However, when I did this, I kept on getting pressure values that were all over the place. When I broke it down, it looked like the &ldquo;offset&rdquo; and &ldquo;scale&rdquo; factors, which rely heavily on bit shifts, were bouncing all over the place.</p>

<p>So, I did some looking, and discovered that, although Node.js stores all its variables as 64-bit floating point numbers, when it comes to bit operations, it does those as 32-bit numbers. A quick test showed that this is true:</p>

<pre><code>&gt; a = Math.pow(2, 31)-1
2147483647
&gt; a &gt;&gt; 10
2097151
&gt; a = Math.pow(2, 32) -1
4294967295
&gt; a &gt;&gt; 10
-1
&gt; a &gt;&gt; 2
-1
</code></pre>

<p>Notice the sharp transition once you hit that 32-bit border. What that meant was that any time I was doing bit operations, if the value I was operating on was less than 2<sup>32</sup>, I got the right answer, otherwise I got garbage. Fun.</p>

<p>So, when I switched to the Java algorithm (modified, of course, because they seem to have forgotten to divide those values by 100 at the end) everything worked.</p>

<p>Good. To. Know.</p>

    <id>http://www.geekheads.net/blog/2013/09/10/published-bluetooth-le-module</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Well, I published my Node.js module for Bluetooth LE, <a href="https://github.com/jacklund/btle.js">btle.js</a> (pronounced &ldquo;Beetle Juice&rdquo;) to <a href="https://npmjs.org/package/btle.js">npm</a>. Even though it&rsquo;s labeled version 0.1.0, it&rsquo;s got most of the functionality that&rsquo;s necessary for Bluetooth LE &ndash; reading attributes, writing commands and requests, and listening for notifications. I&rsquo;m hoping to add more functionality over the next few weeks/months.</p>

<p>The main reason I was doing this was to get my <a href="http://www.ti.com/ww/en/wireless_connectivity/sensortag/index.shtml?DCMP=sensortag&amp;HQS=sensortag-bn">TI SensorTag</a> working with my Raspberry Pi and Bluetooth LE dongle, which it now does. I&rsquo;ve even got the beginnings of a Node.js module for the sensortag, <a href="https://github.com/jacklund/sensortag.js">sensortag.js</a>, which is built on top of btle.js. I&rsquo;ve got everything working except the Barometric Pressure sensor readings and the Gyroscope readings.</p>

<p>The nice thing about btle.js is that it&rsquo;s purely native C++ code, talking directly to the Linux Bluetooth stack &ndash; it&rsquo;s not having to shell out to run gatttool, for instance, which is pretty nice.</p>

<p>For anyone wanting to write some Bluetooth LE code for Linux in a non-Node.js environment, I extracted the low-level I/O code from the <a href="http://www.bluez.org/">Bluez</a> project, removing the dependency on glib so that it&rsquo;s a true, low-level Linux I/O package. The higher-level code is dependant on <a href="https://github.com/joyent/libuv">libuv</a>, of course &ndash; I couldn&rsquo;t figure out any good way to separate them &ndash; but it shouldn&rsquo;t be too difficult to extract what you need from there as well.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Having my new <a href="/jacklund/post/beaglebone-black">BeagleBone Black</a> has made me look at the default programming environment for it, <a href="http://nodejs.org">Node.js</a>. Companies like <a href="http://www.linkedin.com">LinkedIn</a> are <a href="http://engineering.linkedin.com/nodejs/blazing-fast-nodejs-10-performance-tips-linkedin-mobile">using it</a> on the server side, which sort of surprises me. I can definitely see its uses in devices like the BeagleBone, since it has such a small footprint and minimal use of resources, but I was surprised at how many people are using it on the server side.</p>

<p>It makes sense, though &ndash; as <a href="http://wiki.nginx.org/Main">Nginx</a> demonstrated, an event-driven model can eat a thread-based server&rsquo;s lunch, performance-wise, under certain circumstances. What are those circumstances, though?</p>

<p>To begin with, your application would have to be overwhelmingly I/O-bound; anything that does a lot of CPU operations would gain no real benefit from the event-driven model. So, for example, an application which receives requests and stores data in the database without a lot of processing would work really well here. Why? Because in a thread-based model, you would spawn a thread to handle the request, and that thread would be waiting, doing, basically, nothing while waiting for the database request to return. In the Node.js model, you would handle the incoming request, send off an asynchronous call for the database insert, registering a callback, and then handle the next event.</p>

<p>However, if you were doing a lot of processing of the data, your event handler would be running longer than you would really like, and the other requests might get starved. You could get around this by offloading the processing to another service, so you would send off the request, and go about your business until the response came back, and you could respond to your client.</p>

<p>This is all very interesting, and it would be even more interesting to do some performance comparisons of a &ldquo;traditional&rdquo; app written in something like Java vs. a Node.js app.</p>
