    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I&rsquo;m trying to get my Raspberry Pi to talk to my <a href="http://www.ti.com/ww/en/wireless_connectivity/sensortag/index.shtml?INTC=SensorTag&amp;HQS=sensortag">TI Sensortag</a> over Bluetooth LE, using an <a href="http://www.iogear.com/product/GBU521/">IOGear Bluetooth 4.0 USB adapter</a>. I chose that adapter because it is supported by Linux, and so far it works quite nicely with the Pi.</p>

<p>To start with, I&rsquo;d like to write something to pull the sensor data &ndash; temperature, humidity, pressure, etc &ndash; from the SensorTag and publish it over <a href="http://mqtt.org/">MQTT</a>. However, reading the data seems to be problematic.</p>

<p>Problem #1 is that the most-used bluetooth package for Python, <a href="https://code.google.com/p/pybluez/">PyBluez</a> had their last release (0.18) in November, 2009, which, obviously, doesn&rsquo;t include Bluetooth LE. Not a problem, I thought, I&rsquo;ll just fork the project, add the bindings for LE, and off we go!</p>

<p>Which brings me to problem #2: the developers of the <a href="http://www.bluez.org/">BlueZ</a> protocol stack, which is how you access bluetooth from, well, pretty much everywhere, haven&rsquo;t seen fit to include <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bluetooth_profile#Generic_Attribute_Profile_.28GATT.29">GATT</a> support either via a public library or via D-Bus, despite the fact that they&rsquo;ve had the code in their codebase since around 2010.</p>

<p>*<strong><em>facepalm</em></strong>*</p>

<p>Look, I understand that everybody&rsquo;s busy and all, but, really, you couldn&rsquo;t, in the last THREE YEARS break out the GATT code into a library so that people can access it? Really?</p>

<p>Of course, I shouldn&rsquo;t complain, I guess, they do provide a nice little command-line tool, <code>gatttool</code>, to let you do GATT stuff from the command line. Somebody (who is much braver than I) is even trying to <a href="https://github.com/msaunby/ble-sensor-pi">access that via Python and pexpect</a>, which works, sort of, but, uh, really, there has to be a better way.</p>

<p>So, I guess my only option is to pull the GATT code out of the BlueZ project and add it to the Python project. It&rsquo;s ugly, but it&rsquo;s better than expect scripts.</p>

<p>And, really, BlueZ developers: Come on, throw us a bone here.</p>
