    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Well, I published my Node.js module for Bluetooth LE, <a href="https://github.com/jacklund/btle.js">btle.js</a> (pronounced &ldquo;Beetle Juice&rdquo;) to <a href="https://npmjs.org/package/btle.js">npm</a>. Even though it&rsquo;s labeled version 0.1.0, it&rsquo;s got most of the functionality that&rsquo;s necessary for Bluetooth LE &ndash; reading attributes, writing commands and requests, and listening for notifications. I&rsquo;m hoping to add more functionality over the next few weeks/months.</p>

<p>The main reason I was doing this was to get my <a href="http://www.ti.com/ww/en/wireless_connectivity/sensortag/index.shtml?DCMP=sensortag&amp;HQS=sensortag-bn">TI SensorTag</a> working with my Raspberry Pi and Bluetooth LE dongle, which it now does. I&rsquo;ve even got the beginnings of a Node.js module for the sensortag, <a href="https://github.com/jacklund/sensortag.js">sensortag.js</a>, which is built on top of btle.js. I&rsquo;ve got everything working except the Barometric Pressure sensor readings and the Gyroscope readings.</p>

<p>The nice thing about btle.js is that it&rsquo;s purely native C++ code, talking directly to the Linux Bluetooth stack &ndash; it&rsquo;s not having to shell out to run gatttool, for instance, which is pretty nice.</p>

<p>For anyone wanting to write some Bluetooth LE code for Linux in a non-Node.js environment, I extracted the low-level I/O code from the <a href="http://www.bluez.org/">Bluez</a> project, removing the dependency on glib so that it&rsquo;s a true, low-level Linux I/O package. The higher-level code is dependant on <a href="https://github.com/joyent/libuv">libuv</a>, of course &ndash; I couldn&rsquo;t figure out any good way to separate them &ndash; but it shouldn&rsquo;t be too difficult to extract what you need from there as well.</p>

    <id>http://www.geekheads.net/blog/2013/07/01/Got-Them-Bluetooth-LE-Bluez</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I&rsquo;m trying to get my Raspberry Pi to talk to my <a href="http://www.ti.com/ww/en/wireless_connectivity/sensortag/index.shtml?INTC=SensorTag&amp;HQS=sensortag">TI Sensortag</a> over Bluetooth LE, using an <a href="http://www.iogear.com/product/GBU521/">IOGear Bluetooth 4.0 USB adapter</a>. I chose that adapter because it is supported by Linux, and so far it works quite nicely with the Pi.</p>

<p>To start with, I&rsquo;d like to write something to pull the sensor data &ndash; temperature, humidity, pressure, etc &ndash; from the SensorTag and publish it over <a href="http://mqtt.org/">MQTT</a>. However, reading the data seems to be problematic.</p>

<p>Problem #1 is that the most-used bluetooth package for Python, <a href="https://code.google.com/p/pybluez/">PyBluez</a> had their last release (0.18) in November, 2009, which, obviously, doesn&rsquo;t include Bluetooth LE. Not a problem, I thought, I&rsquo;ll just fork the project, add the bindings for LE, and off we go!</p>

<p>Which brings me to problem #2: the developers of the <a href="http://www.bluez.org/">BlueZ</a> protocol stack, which is how you access bluetooth from, well, pretty much everywhere, haven&rsquo;t seen fit to include <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bluetooth_profile#Generic_Attribute_Profile_.28GATT.29">GATT</a> support either via a public library or via D-Bus, despite the fact that they&rsquo;ve had the code in their codebase since around 2010.</p>

<p>*<strong><em>facepalm</em></strong>*</p>

<p>Look, I understand that everybody&rsquo;s busy and all, but, really, you couldn&rsquo;t, in the last THREE YEARS break out the GATT code into a library so that people can access it? Really?</p>

<p>Of course, I shouldn&rsquo;t complain, I guess &ndash; they do provide a nice little command-line tool, <code>gatttool</code>, to let you do GATT stuff, just nothing to do, you know, programming with. Somebody (who is much braver than I) is even trying to <a href="https://github.com/msaunby/ble-sensor-pi">access that via Python and pexpect</a>, which works, sort of, but, uh, really, there has to be a better way.</p>

<p>So, I guess my only option is to pull the GATT code out of the BlueZ project and add it to the Python project. It&rsquo;s ugly, but it&rsquo;s better than expect scripts.</p>

<p>And, really, BlueZ developers: Come on, throw us a bone here.</p>

<h3>Update</h3>

<p>Well, it looks like I spoke too soon. Because the BlueZ developers have the GATT-layer stuff hooked heavily into glib 2.0 using callbacks, it would be much more work than I&rsquo;m willing to put into it to do this within Python, which probably explains why nobody else has done it either. Thanks again, BlueZ team! <em>sigh</em></p>

<p>So, I guess what I&rsquo;m going to have to end up doing is writing all this in C/C++, and pulling parts of their GATT code into my project. Either that, or just implementing the parts I need myself.</p>

<p>My guess is that the BlueZ developers are really more interested in writing kernel code than user-space code. It really sucks for anybody who wants to play with LE applications, though &ndash; right now everybody seems to be just writing wrappers around the BlueZ command-line apps and calling it a day. Not a great way to help with adoption of a standard, guys!</p>
