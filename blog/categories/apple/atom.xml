    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Had to replace my old, crappy Netgear router over the weekend &ndash; it was getting flaky, and causing my Skype calls to freak out at inopportune moments. I was thinking about going the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DD-WRT">DD-WRT</a> route (if you&rsquo;ll excuse the pun), but it looked like it required more of a time commitment than I am able to manage at the moment. Since almost everything we have in this house is some form of Apple product, I decided to try out the Airport Extreme.</p>

<p>Man, was that thing easy to set up, especially compared to the Living Hell that is most router setups. I just went into Airport Utility on my laptop, it automagically found the router, I configured it right there, and it just frickin' worked! Unbelievable! Admittedly, it&rsquo;s a pricey router, but I think it&rsquo;s worth it with the time it saved me.</p>

<p>It also seems to be a <strong>lot</strong> more powerful than those underpowered Netgear POSes, which is an added benefit.</p>
