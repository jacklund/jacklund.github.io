<p>I got my <a href="http://processors.wiki.ti.com/index.php/Bluetooth_SensorTag">TI Bluetooth SensorTag</a> Friday, and played with it some over the weekend. It&rsquo;s pretty nice. It&rsquo;s basically a small device with a bunch of embedded sensors on it &ndash; accelerometer, gyroscope, ambient temp, IR temp (see below), humidity, barometric pressure, and a couple of buttons on it. It&rsquo;s very small, and communicates over <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bluetooth_low_energy">Bluetooth 4 LE</a>. You can download an iOS app for viewing the data, so my daughters and I played with it some. Pretty cool. There&rsquo;s a <a href="http://blog.makezine.com/2013/04/18/teardown-of-the-ti-sensortag">teardown of it</a> at MAKE magazine, and even a <a href="http://mike.saunby.net/2013/04/raspberry-pi-and-ti-cc2541-sensortag.html">Raspberry Pi</a> project to interface with it. W00t!!!</p>
