<p>As I mentioned earlier, we&rsquo;re transitioning from subversion to git, and one of the things we need to do is convert from many-projects-per-repository, which is what we had in subversion, to one-project-per-repository for git. This is partly to make things nicer, and partly because it will make <a href="http://jenkins-ci.org/">Jenkins</a> work better. So, thinking in subversion-terms, I thought I&rsquo;d have to do it myself, and even tried by renaming all the files in one of the projects into the upper-level directory, removing all the other projects, committing locally, and then pushing to a new repo. Royal pain.</p>

<p>And then, I came across <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/splitting-a-subpath-out-into-a-new-repository">this</a>. Oh. My. God. Git actually does the work for you. It&rsquo;s so easy, you just do the <code>git filter-branch</code> command, and suddenly your project is its own repository! Then, you just change the remote repository (<code>git remote rm origin</code> followed by <code>git remote add</code> <em>new-url</em>), and Bob&rsquo;s your uncle, you have a new, smaller repository.</p>

<p>I mean, seriously? That is AWESOME!</p>

<p>So, to be explicit, here&rsquo;s the series of commands:</p>

<pre><code>$ git clone repo-url
$ cd repo
$ git filter-branch --prune-empty --subdirectory-filter subdir-name master
$ git remote rm origin
$ git remote add new-repo-url
$ git push -u origin --all --tags
</code></pre>

Okay, after messing around with this for some time, I&rsquo;ve discovered that the above doesn&rsquo;t work quite right, because the pathnames in the commits are wrong &ndash; instead of being <em>subdir-name</em><code>/src/foo/Bar.java</code>, it ends up being <code>src/foo/Bar.java</code>, which doesn&rsquo;t work. So, instead of trying to pull each subdirectory into their own repository, I&rsquo;m taking the existing repository, with a bunch of subdirs, including the ones I&rsquo;m interested in, and simply using <code>git filter-branch</code> to get rid of the ones I&rsquo;m not interested in, as well as update the tags. So, here&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;ve got now, which seems to work well:</p>
