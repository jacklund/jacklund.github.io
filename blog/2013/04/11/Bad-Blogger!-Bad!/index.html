<p>It&rsquo;s been over a year since I last used <a href="http://scriptogr.am">scriptogr.am</a>. Mostly I haven&rsquo;t had much time to actually post &ndash; work has been rather intense, but in a good way. :&ndash;)</p>

<p>Recently, I&rsquo;ve been looking around for blog solutions, and I keep coming back to this.  I&rsquo;ve been getting more and more into using <a href="http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/">Markdown</a>, and <a href="http://fletcherpenney.net/multimarkdown/">MultiMarkdown</a> for lots of things, from note taking to creating documents. I&rsquo;ll try to put together another post about that sometime soon. However, for blogging, I wanted to use Markdown, so I looked at <a href="http://jekyllrb.com/">jekyll</a>, which is what <a href="http://pages.github.com/">github pages</a> uses, but it kind of requires some work in terms of setting up the templates, css, etc (although there is a <a href="http://jekyllbootstrap.com/">Jekyll Bootstrap</a> project which helps a lot), and, being the lazy (not to mention busy) guy I am, I decided it was too much work after futzing with it for a couple of hours.</p>

<p>This seems to be the most painless solution, so I&rsquo;m going with it.</p>

<p>Code blocks seem to be handled relatively well:</p>

<pre><code>public class Foo {
  private int bar;

  public int getBar() {
    return bar;
  }
}
</code></pre>

<p>So, I&rsquo;ll stick with this, for now.</p>
