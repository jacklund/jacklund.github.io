<p>About 3 AM Stef woke up complaining about chills. I tried to keep her warm, but she had a real hard time getting back to sleep. This morning, she had a 100 degree fever &ndash; clearly the Flu. Unfortunately, she had scheduled the family party for the girl&rsquo;s birthday today. I wanted to postpone/cancel it, but she felt like the girls were really excited about it, and didn&rsquo;t want to disappoint them. It turned out kind of nice &ndash; I grilled burgers and brats despite the rainy cold weather, and we all ate, and the girls opened presents.</p>

<p>Stef spent the rest of the day crashed out (in fact, she&rsquo;s crashed out right now on the sofa next to me).</p>

<p>I also had heartburn all day, starting after breakfast. Everything I ate seemed to trigger it, so at dinner I opted for the BRAT diet (Bananas Rice Applesauce Toast) which seemed to make things better.</p>

<p>The girls seemed to like their party.</p>
