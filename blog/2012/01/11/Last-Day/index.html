<p>Morning of my last day at the old job. Came down with what could be either a sinus or ear infection last night &ndash; no energy, feelling somewhat dizzy. For some reason, they don&rsquo;t really have anything planned for me today, but they want to keep me at work all day &ndash; they&rsquo;ve planned my exit interview after the close. Oh, well.</p>

<p>On the plus side, got a good bit done on building my home office desk last night, before this infection thing hit me. Still have the desk to finish, my chair and bookcase to put together, whiteboard to mount, network stuff to move downstairs, and my machines to set up. Busy, busy, busy.</p>
