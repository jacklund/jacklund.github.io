  <div class="entry-content"><p>We&rsquo;re transitioning, as a company, from Subversion to Git, which is a Good Thing, but has its complications. One of them was getting <a href="http://jenkins-ci.org/">Jenkins</a>, which we use for <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_integration">continuous integration</a>, to work with our Git repositories.</p>

<p>I had started out by thinking that I would have to create a user in our repository provider (we&rsquo;re using <a href="http://bitbucket.org">BitBucket</a>) which would have read permisisons to our repositories, a &ldquo;jenkins&rdquo; user. Turns out its not the case. All you need to do for read-only access is to generate SSH keys that you register with the repository, and which Jenkins uses to clone the repository.</p>

<p>On Linux, this would be trivial. On Windows, of course, very little is trivial.</p>

<p>So, following <a href="http://computercamp.cdwilson.us/jenkins-git-clone-via-ssh-on-windows-7-x64">this guide</a>(with some modifications) I managed it this way:</p>

<ol>
<li>Install <a href="http://git-scm.com/downloads">Git</a></li>
<li>Generate the new SSH keys on my local machine using <code>ssh-keygen</code>. Make sure to specify a file <strong>other</strong> than the default (unless you like the idea of overwriting any existing keys you might have).</li>
<li>Install the public key in the repository. In BitBucket, you do this under the account settings for the user or group who owns the repositories. Do it at the user/group level, not at the repository level (unless you want separate keys for each repository). Just cut and paste the contents of the public key to the web page, and click &ldquo;Add&rdquo;</li>
<li>Install <a href="http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/bb896649.aspx">PsTools</a> (<em>Note</em>: the link given in the guide mentioned above didn&rsquo;t work for me). Extract the zip file wherever you want (I put mine in the root dir)</li>
<li>Run the following in a command shell <em>running as administrator</em>: <code>\PsTools\PsExec.exe -i -s cmd.exe</code> (<em>Note:</em> the guide says use a normal shell, but that will fail the first time, because it tries to instal something that needs Admin privileges). To do this, find the command shell icon in the menu, right-click, and select <em>Run as Administrator&hellip;</em>.</li>
<li>Do <code>echo %USERPROFILE%</code> in the shell to find out where the system user (and, hence, Jenkins) runs from as its home directory. Mine turned out to be <code>C:\Windows\system32\config\systemprofile</code>. YMMV.</li>
<li>Make a folder named <code>.ssh</code> in that home directory</li>
<li>Copy the keys (private and public) to the Windows machine in the <code>.ssh</code> folder</li>
<li>Run <code>"C:\Program Files(x86)\Git\bin\ssh.exe" -T git@bitbucket.org</code> (<em>Note:</em> the location of git on your install may be different than mine). When you get the usual &ldquo;unknown host&rdquo; warning, type &ldquo;yes&rdquo; to get the server key in your known_hosts file</li>
<li>Finally, test git by doing a <code>git ls-remote git@bitbucket.org:repo.git HEAD</code></li>
</ol>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>So, I&rsquo;ve been rethinking the architecture we used with a customer, and which we are planning on using, in slightly modified form, for some in-house projects.</p>

<p>The application is, basically, a cloud-based service which takes data from devices, analyzes and stores it, and presents it to the user in a web site.</p>

<p>We had decided, early on, to go with Java as our language of choice, both because it was what the customer was comfortable with, and because we felt like it offered the best performance/flexibility tradeoff (and, yes, performance is an issue here, especially on the data collection side).</p>

<p>The pieces of our architecture include:</p>

<ul>
<li>A <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rest">RESTful</a> web service, to both collect the data and to serve as an API for apps which want to access the data</li>
<li>Some sort of queuing mechanism for taking the data in, and processing it on the back end asynchronously</li>
<li>A database of some sort for storing the readings</li>
<li>A website, utilizing static HTML and Javascript for accessing and presenting the data, and for managing the various assets (devices, etc)</li>
<li>A database (possibly the same as the previous one) for storing the website data</li>
<li>A notification framework for sending notifications (emails, SMS, etc) of various events from the devices</li>
</ul>


<p>Now, one of the things I&rsquo;ve learned about architecture (or, at least I thought I had learned) was to only use what you absolutely need, nothing more. A lean architecture is a good architecture. However, we made some decisions early on which, now, I feel like violate those principles.</p>

<h3>JBoss</h3>

<p>We opted to put the code in an app server for various reasons. We needed a Servlet engine to facilitate the web service, but we decided to use <a href="http://www.jboss.org/jbossas">JBoss AS 7</a> as the app server because we&rsquo;d all had experience with it in the past, and it was being used by the customer currently. We felt like the container could manage all the &ldquo;plumbing&rdquo; (threads, database connections, etc), rather than dealing with it ourselves. I think that decision came more from old architectural design assumptions (&ldquo;three-tiered good, two-tiered bad&rdquo;, &ldquo;managing resources is hard&rdquo;) which are no longer really relevant.</p>

<p>However, more importantly (and I don&rsquo;t mean to bash JBoss here, I think this would be true of any app server), we ended up severely limiting our &ldquo;functional&rdquo; scalability by using an app server. Let me explain:</p>

<p>When I refer to &ldquo;functional&rdquo; vs. &ldquo;theoretical&rdquo; scalability, I&rsquo;m referring to the fact that, while JBoss is certainly very scalable in theory (you can cluster the instances, and add new instances dynamically), in practice, it&rsquo;s really frickin&#8217; difficult to scale. The reason: you can&rsquo;t just &ldquo;add another instance&rdquo;, you need to go through the hell that is cluster configuration to add a new instance, which means, literally, making on the order of a dozen changes to the stock JBoss configuration files.</p>

<p>To put an even finer point on it: the question you should ask yourself in terms of scalability is: if I were to get a call at 2 AM that we need to scale up because the application&rsquo;s pegged, could I scale it quickly and easily, even half-asleep? The answer in this case would be a resounding &ldquo;No!&rdquo;.</p>

<p>The other answer might be to use a deployment system, like <a href="http://www.opscode.com/chef/">Chef</a> or <a href="https://puppetlabs.com/">Puppet</a>, but I&rsquo;ve tried putting together Puppet scripts for doing a JBoss clustered deployment, and it&rsquo;s a nightmare as well.</p>

<p>A lot of this came out of a gig we had auditing another consulting company for a customer. They hired us to talk to the other company with them, because things weren&rsquo;t going well and they needed a second opinion on whether they were being &ldquo;took&rdquo; (we said &ldquo;yes, kinda&rdquo;). However, the most interesting thing was that they had a very similar architecture to ours, but it was seriously slow, so they were constantly having to add in servers in the back end. The sys admin who worked there (and who was probably the smartest guy in the company, as far as I could tell), pointed out that starting up new instances was trivial, because their backend server was a simple process &ndash; no app server, no nothing. He could start it up from the command line if he wanted.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s how it all <strong><em>should</em></strong> work! It&rsquo;s the Google/Facebook architecture vs. the old-school &ldquo;Big Iron&rdquo; approach. It was a serious &ldquo;Aha!&rdquo; moment for me.</p>

<p>So, what are we getting from using JBoss? EJBs? We are using them, but we don&rsquo;t need them (they&rsquo;re not on the list I mentioned above) &ndash; the web service should be our internal as well as our external API. Thread pools? They used to be complicated, but since JDK 1.5, it&rsquo;s trivial. Database connection pools? Same thing. Caching? We&rsquo;re using a third-party caching mechanism, so no.</p>

<p>Time to ditch JBoss.</p>

<h3>HornetQ</h3>

<p>The queue that comes with JBoss is <a href="http://www.jboss.org/hornetq">HornetQ</a>. It&rsquo;s supposedly a very fast queue, and it comes embedded in JBoss. However, there are several issues with it:</p>

<ul>
<li>It, also, doesn&rsquo;t functionally scale well. You can cluster it, but it&rsquo;s painful, and a configuration nightmare, just like JBoss</li>
<li>It doesn&rsquo;t handle having the queue fill up very gracefully, in my opinion. While I was doing load testing of the app, sometimes the back end would not quite be able to keep up, and when a large number of journal files ended up in the queue, it froze, and needed not just to be restarted, but to have the journal files cleared out first.</li>
<li>It&rsquo;s not trivial swapping out a different queue in JBoss. It&rsquo;s doable, but not very well documented, and it&rsquo;s hard to say how JBoss would handle it.</li>
</ul>


<h3>Spring</h3>

<p>Another questionable architectural decision (and I can say this because I was one of the big advocates) was to use <a href="http://www.springsource.org/">Spring</a>. Now, don&rsquo;t get me wrong &ndash; I <em>love</em> Spring, but it has a tendency to take over once you start using it. We had even talked about, early on, how we weren&rsquo;t going to use Spring for &ldquo;everything&rdquo;, but we ended up using it way too much, IMHO. Plus, I think if we rearchitect everything to be in terms of standalone services, we&rsquo;ll have a lot less need for that sort of configurational complexity.</p>

<h3>Emphasize the Positive</h3>

<p>So, those are the things I think we should ditch. What should our architecture look like? I think we could function well with the web services being in something like <a href="http://tomcat.apache.org/">Tomcat</a> or <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/jetty/">Jetty</a>, with everything else being standalone Java services (i.e., no containers, just POJOs with a main()).</p>

<p>That takes care of the big pieces, but what about the glue to put it together? I was looking around for scalable, distributed queues, when I came across <a href="http://kafka.apache.org/">Kafka</a>. It&rsquo;s not really a queue so much as a pub/sub framework, which you can use like a queue. However, once I started playing with it (which will be the subject of a different post), I came to the realization that it could be used for more than just the queue &ndash; it could be the communication mechanism between the services, basically a communication bus for the architecture. And, it&rsquo;s functionally scalable, because you can add new server instances dynamically using <a href="http://zookeeper.apache.org/">ZooKeeper</a>. We could also reuse ZooKeeper as our own service locater service to allow us to dynamically add new services.</p>

<p>Now, suddenly, things are looking very different. Rather than an app server with all our code deployed on it, we would have compact, self-contained services which communicate via Kafka, find new instances via ZooKeeper, and which scale by just starting up new instances to take on the load. Doing this then implies that the web service front-end would have to be very thin &ndash; just a façade for taking in web service requests, which would then be delegated to the back-end services.</p>

<p>The key would be to define the services well, so they would be small, light, decoupled, and cohesive.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>It&rsquo;s been over a year since I last used <a href="http://scriptogr.am">scriptogr.am</a>. Mostly I haven&rsquo;t had much time to actually post &ndash; work has been rather intense, but in a good way. :&ndash;)</p>

<p>Recently, I&rsquo;ve been looking around for blog solutions, and I keep coming back to this.  I&rsquo;ve been getting more and more into using <a href="http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/">Markdown</a>, and <a href="http://fletcherpenney.net/multimarkdown/">MultiMarkdown</a> for lots of things, from note taking to creating documents. I&rsquo;ll try to put together another post about that sometime soon. However, for blogging, I wanted to use Markdown, so I looked at <a href="http://jekyllrb.com/">jekyll</a>, which is what <a href="http://pages.github.com/">github pages</a> uses, but it kind of requires some work in terms of setting up the templates, css, etc (although there is a <a href="http://jekyllbootstrap.com/">Jekyll Bootstrap</a> project which helps a lot), and, being the lazy (not to mention busy) guy I am, I decided it was too much work after futzing with it for a couple of hours.</p>

<p>This seems to be the most painless solution, so I&rsquo;m going with it.</p>

<p>Code blocks seem to be handled relatively well:</p>

<pre><code>public class Foo {
  private int bar;

  public int getBar() {
    return bar;
  }
}
</code></pre>

<p>So, I&rsquo;ll stick with this, for now.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I finally figured out how to get Ant + Ivy to copy artifacts from one Artifactory repository to another, modifying the appropriate metadata (AKA &ldquo;promotion&rdquo;). First, you need a separate ivy.xml file (I call mine &ldquo;ivy-publish.xml&rdquo;) that looks like this:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;ivy-module version="2.0"
       xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
       xsi:noNamespaceSchemaLocation=
         "http://ant.apache.org/ivy/schemas/ivy.xsd"&gt;
    &lt;info organisation="foo" module="FooDeploy" status="integration" /&gt;

    &lt;configurations&gt;
        &lt;conf name="integration"/&gt;
        &lt;conf name="milestone"/&gt;
        &lt;conf name="release"/&gt;
    &lt;/configurations&gt;

    &lt;publications&gt;
        &lt;artifact name="Foo" ext="war" /&gt;
        &lt;artifact name="Foo-src" ext="jar" /&gt;
    &lt;/publications&gt;

    &lt;dependencies&gt;
        &lt;dependency org="foo" name="Foo" rev="latest.integration"
          conf="integration-&gt;deploy" transitive="false" /&gt;
        &lt;dependency org="foo" name="Foo" rev="latest.milestone"
          conf="milestone-&gt;deploy" transitive="false" /&gt;
        &lt;dependency org="foo" name="Foo" rev="latest.release"
          conf="release-&gt;deploy" transitive="false" /&gt;
    &lt;/dependencies&gt;
&lt;/ivy-module&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>And then, you need an ant target that looks like this:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;target name="publish-stage"&gt;
    &lt;ivy:configure file="${common.build.dir}/ivysettings.xml"
        host="myserver" realm="Artifactory Realm" username="user"
        passwd="password!" override="true" /&gt;
    &lt;ivy:retrieve file="ivy-publish.xml" conf="integration"
        pattern="${ivy.lib.dir}/[conf]/[artifact].[ext]"
            ivypattern="${ivy.lib.dir}/[conf]/ivy.xml"/&gt;
    &lt;ivy:buildnumber organisation="${ivy.organisation}"
        module="${ivy.module}" revision="1.0" defaultBuildNumber="1"
        resolver="stage" /&gt;
    &lt;ivy:publish resolver="stage"
        pubrevision="1.0.${ivy.new.build.number}"
        status="milestone" overwrite="true" update="true"&gt;
        &lt;artifacts pattern="${lib}/integration/[artifact].[ext]" /&gt;
    &lt;/ivy:publish&gt;
&lt;/target&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>What this does is first retrieve the &ldquo;dependencies&rdquo; (the artifacts we&rsquo;re interested in) specified in the ivy-publish.xml file to lib/integration. Then, it turns around and publishes them, changing the status from &ldquo;integration&rdquo; to &ldquo;milestone&rdquo;.</p>

<p>Works like a charm.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>We&rsquo;re using Ant + Ivy + Jenkins + Artifactory to do our builds &ndash; Ant to build, Ivy for dependency management, Jenkins for continuous integration, and Artifactory to store the build artifacts. One thing we&rsquo;re struggling with is how to promote an artifact through the three stages &ndash; build &ndash;> stage &ndash;> release. Jenkins puts it into the build repository once it passes CI, so that part is easy. However, having an automated process for moving the artifacts from build to stage and from stage to release is painful, at best, which is surprising.</p>

<p>The problem is with Ivy. It&rsquo;s a pretty good tool for dependency management &ndash; it finds and downloads specific versions of jars for you, which is nice, but it&rsquo;s not so good at going outside that realm, like, for instance, pulling down an artifact from the repository, and then pushing it back again with updated metadata, into a different repository.</p>

<p>We&rsquo;ve tried just specifying the artifact as the depndency, giving it a revision of &ldquo;latest.integration&rdquo; to pull it from build, and then publishing to stage, for instance, but Ivy complains that it can&rsquo;t be its own dependency, which makes sense. We&rsquo;ve tried publishing it as a different module name to stage, for instance, but then you run into the same problem getting it from stage to release.</p>

<p>There has to be a better way. Unfortunately, the Artifactory people aren&rsquo;t much help &ndash; their solutions involve buying their &ldquo;pro&rdquo; version, and using their REST interface. Blech.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>About 3 AM Stef woke up complaining about chills. I tried to keep her warm, but she had a real hard time getting back to sleep. This morning, she had a 100 degree fever &ndash; clearly the Flu. Unfortunately, she had scheduled the family party for the girl&rsquo;s birthday today. I wanted to postpone/cancel it, but she felt like the girls were really excited about it, and didn&rsquo;t want to disappoint them. It turned out kind of nice &ndash; I grilled burgers and brats despite the rainy cold weather, and we all ate, and the girls opened presents.</p>

<p>Stef spent the rest of the day crashed out (in fact, she&rsquo;s crashed out right now on the sofa next to me).</p>

<p>I also had heartburn all day, starting after breakfast. Everything I ate seemed to trigger it, so at dinner I opted for the BRAT diet (Bananas Rice Applesauce Toast) which seemed to make things better.</p>

<p>The girls seemed to like their party.</p>

I&rsquo;ve discovered that cranking up the Young Dubliners station on Pandora is a good way to wake up &ndash; just the right mix of Punk and Irish pissed-off-edness. Usually have to tone it down by noon, but still, a good way to get things going.</p>

<p>Had to buy a space heater for my office &ndash; it being around zero with wind chill outside now. Still, I got a good bit done today &ndash; rearranged some of the projects and package names, created a couple of services which our front-end web service will use to validate the data coming in, created a nightly job to generate the javadocs and publish them on the web. Also, got Redmine and svn to play nice together, so now we should be able to associate issues and fixes with specific versions of code.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>My first day of work in the new office in my basement. Worked out pretty well, although I <em>do</em> need to figure out a way to take more frequent breaks, and maybe do something at lunchtime other than sitting.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve discovered more really cool stuff with <a href="http://www.jboss.org/resteasy">RESTEasy</a>: not only does it automagically convert JSON to java.util.Map&lt;String, Object>, but it also can convert XML input into an org.w3c.dom.Document. Also, they were thoughtful enough to allow you to have different interface methods for different content types for the same URI, which means that I can have data coming in as JSON call one method (the one with a Map&lt;String, Object> in the signature), and XML call another. Really cool.</p>

<p>Also, got my Groovy integration tests working. Since our architecture is basically a RESTful web service putting data onto a queue, and a MDB taking it off and calling multiple handlers to handle it, I just created another handler to dump the data onto a queue which the integration test reads from (remotely), allowing me to make sure the data got all the way through intact. Very nice.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>So, one of the other guys in my new company ordered the parts for a Linux server to be sent to me (because we still live in a time when it&rsquo;s cheaper to build your own Linux server than to buy one pre-made), which I built the other day. This was somewhat interesting in that I haven&rsquo;t put together a new machine in quite a while, but, fortunately, it seems like these things get easier rather than harder as the technology progresses.</p>

<p>The machine was built, and I had to add services to it. The first thing we needed was our Redmine installation, which up until now was running on my home Linux box. Both machines are running Ubuntu (for no other reason than it&rsquo;s easily accessible and has a very large user base), so it was just a matter of installing MySQL and Redmine from the Ubuntu repos, dumping the MySQL database from the other machine and moving it to this machine. This worked…mostly. For some strange reason the user passwords didn&rsquo;t work, so I had to start by resetting the admin password (using the instructions from <a href="http://www.redmine.org/boards/2/topics/3364">this post</a>), and then resetting all the user passwords. The only other hitch was that the main page reset to the default main page rather than the wiki page for my company, which I had set up a while ago. Easy enough to fix with <a href="http://www.supermind.org/blog/830/change-redmine-homepage-to-project-page">these instructions</a>. So far so good.</p>

<p>Next, I had to move our subversion repository over from a machine running Windows to this new server. Again, easy enough, you just have to dump the repository and load it again, as per <a href="http://dotnot.org/blog/archives/2005/01/13/move-a-subversion-repository-from-one-machine-to-another/">these instructions</a>. Then, I just had to make sure svn+ssh worked (I had already setup SSH on the machine and set up accounts for our guys), and then I had to setup SVN through WebDAV, which was really just a matter of enabling some of the Apache mods.</p>

<p>The big kicker, though, was that I&rsquo;m temporarily hosting our server at my house, so it&rsquo;s part of my network. Since I already have a web server (on my Linux box) running exposed to the world, for Redmine, I had to enable mod_proxy on my home Linux box to reverse-proxy the requests to the new box. WebDAV I simply made HTTPS, so I could set up a separate port forward for it directly to the new box.</p>

<p>All in all, one big sysadmin day for a guy who doesn&rsquo;t especially like sysadmin work.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Had a killer eskrima class this morning. In the kids class, Guro worked us hard &ndash; one minute of strikes against the bag as fast as we can, alternating with planks and footwork. After that, during the adult class, lots of sparring. I ended up sparring continuously for, like, ten minutes, with only a few seconds break between rounds. It felt a lot better than last week&rsquo;s &ndash; I had a hard time getting back into the groove right after the holidays.</p>

<p>After class, dropped the girls off to their first practice for their Willy Wonka musical, came back and had to do some sysadmin work for my lovely wife, then went back and picked up the girls, and we went sledding down the hill next to the Gurnee Park District building, where their musical practice was. Lots of fun, but after the class in the morning (and me being off my workout schedule and recovering from a sinus infection) it pretty much wiped me out.</p>

<p>Then, I came home and put Ubuntu on the work Linux machine I built over the last couple of days. I got it installed, and set up on the network. Now, I just need to set up accounts, start up the services, install all the stuff we need, and we should be golden.</p>

<p>Busy, busy day.</p>
