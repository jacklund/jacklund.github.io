I'm Jack, a programmer working devops for a Large Tech Firm. Most of my background is in application programming -
I've done everything from scientific programming, graphics, cryptography, and trading apps - but over the last ten years or so
I've drifted into more devops-y stuff, lots of Terraform, Ansible, Python, etc.

My interests include, but are not restricted to, the following:

- Programming, specifically [Rust programming](https://www.rust-lang.org/)
- Cryptography and security
- [Locksport](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Locksport), i.e., picking locks for fun
- Books (_lots_ of books)
- Math
- Physics
- Anarchism
- Taoism and Zen Buddhism
- [Martial arts](/martial_arts)

I'm also a dad to two college-age daughters and a husband to a (very patient) wife.
