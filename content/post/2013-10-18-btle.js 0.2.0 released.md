title: btle.js 0.2.0 released
---

I just (okay, a few days ago) released version 0.2.0 of
[btle.js](https://github.com/jacklund/btle.js) to\
[npm](https://npmjs.org/package/btle.js). This has a bunch of API
changes - the `connect` method now gives you a\
`Device` object, instead of a `Connection`. All the ATT methods are now
on the `Device` object, but, in addition, you can\
access all the GATT functionality by querying the device for services,
which returns `Service` objects, and services for\
characteristics, which return `Characteristics` objects.

I\'m also working on [API
docs](https://github.com/jacklund/btle.js/wiki/API-Docs) for the whole
thing.
