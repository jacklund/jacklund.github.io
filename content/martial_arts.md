I'm currently teaching Eskrima (Filipino martial arts), and have been for the last 10 years or so.

I've also trained in the following (in roughly chronological order):
- Judo as a child
- [Moo Duk Kwan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moo_Duk_Kwan) as a teenager
- Chayon Ryu, Hung Gar and Taiji with [Master John Blankenship](https://blankenshipmartialarts.com/) in Austin
- Combat [Shuai Jiao](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shuai_jiao), Northern Long Fist, Praying Mantis and Baji Quan with [John Wang](https://www.combatshuaichiaoatx.com/) in Austin
- Boxing, Wing Chun and Cabales Eskrima with Waldo Oca√±a in Chicago
