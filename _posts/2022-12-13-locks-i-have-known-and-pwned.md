I've been doing lockpicking as a
["sport"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Locksport) since about March of this
year. Back when I lived in Austin, I got a cheap lockpicking set and played
around with picking the locks on the house I lived in. I'm not exactly sure
what drove me to start doing that again, but, I gotta say, it's a lot of fun
(not to mention a great way to keep your hands busy when you're in a meeting -
needless to say, I work remotely).

I mainly worked through the [Reddit belt
ranking](https://www.lockpickersunited.org/beltsystem/belts/) system, which is
a good way to find easier locks to start with and slowly increase the
difficulty as you go. I used a lot of resources in learning, mostly on youtube,
which I'll talk about in a later blog post.

# Lingo

There's a lot of jargon associated with this stuff, as in all such things. Here's a few I'll be using:

- Single pin picking (SPP) vs. Raking - there's a pretty good explanation of
  this [here](https://unitedlocksmith.net/blog/raking-vs-single-pin-picking).
  Basically, the stuff you see in the movies is SPP, usually. Raking is faster,
  but less reliable.
- Different pin types - the pins that make contact with the key, colored red in
  [this illustration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pin_tumbler_lock#Design).
  "Standard" pins are normal, cylindrical pins. Some locks have so-called
  [security pins](http://lockwiki.com/index.php/Security_pin), which are
  designed to make picking more difficult, including spool and serrated pins.
- Bottom-of-keyway (BOK) vs. top-of-keyway (TOK) tension - where you put your
  tension wrench, either at the bottom or at the top. There are tradeoffs for
  each. There's a pretty decent description
  [here](https://unitedlocksmith.net/blog/how-to-pick-locks-the-definitive-guide-to-lock-picking#section-6),
  although I disagree with their assessment of the pros/cons

# Tools I Like

I tend to like [Peterson](https://www.thinkpeterson.com/) tools because, well,
I've got big, clumsy hands, and they have a very nice handle which is easier
for me to grip. I also, in particular, like the [Peterson hook 1](https://www.thinkpeterson.com/hook-1-plastic-gov-steel/),
because it has this nice flat area that makes lifting pins really easy. I tend
to use what's probably considered a lot of tension, so I like using the
wrenches with a twist in the handle. I tend to start with single-pin picking
(SPP) rather than raking (see
[here](https://unitedlocksmith.net/blog/raking-vs-single-pin-picking) for an
explanation of the difference), because, well, it's more fun. I also favor
bottom-of-keyway (BOK) tension over top-of-keyway (TOK), because I find that I
actually prefer having my pick closer to the pins when picking (there are
exceptions, though, especially with tighter keyways or locks with the short
rear pins followed by longer pins).

I'll list the locks that follow in more-or-less order of easiest to hardest.

# Padlocks

## Master Lock #3

![Master Lock #3](/assets/images/2022-12-12 17.33.17.jpg){: width="250" }
![Master Lock #3 keyway](/assets/images/2022-04-24 17.22.16.jpg){: width="250" }
![Master Lock #3 key](/assets/images/2022-12-12 17.33.49.jpg){: width="400" }

This is the classic Master lock people had on their school gym lockers back in
the day (or, at least, back in _my_ day). It's got 4 pins, all standard. As you
can see from the key, the pin depths are all pretty much the same, so raking
this is really easy, as is SPP. The only slightly challenging thing about this
lock is that the cylinder is spring-loaded, so that it pushes against your
tension while you're picking. What this means in practice is you can have
picked it open, and not know it unless you happen to put more tension and feel
it rotate. Not terrible, but occasionally annoying.

## Master Lock 140

![Master Lock 140](/assets/images/2022-12-12 17.56.19.jpg){: width="250" } ![Master Lock 140 key](/assets/images/2022-12-12 17.54.20.jpg){: width="400" }

This...is just a terrible lock. Cheaply made, the variation in pin lengths is
laughable because of such a tiny key. It's like they took one of those tiny
suitcase locks and made it slightly bigger.

It pretty much rakes open the moment you push the rake in. SPP is challenging
only because the keyway is so small (I usually end up TOK-ing it), and because
the construction is so cheap it's hard to tell when the pin sets because just
raising the pins causes vibration from, I'm guessing, the badly made cylinder.

Hate this lock.

## Master Lock 930

![Master Lock 930](/assets/images/2022-12-12 18.17.49.jpg){: width="250" } ![Master Lock 930 key](/assets/images/2022-12-12 18.17.59.jpg){: width="400" }

Another terrible lock from Master Lock. The only thing this has going for it is
that you'd need a small thermonuclear device to crack it open. The shackle (the
curved part you attach to whatever you're trying to lock) sits loose in the
lock even when locked securely. When you unlock it, it doesn't pop open like
most locks, you have to push the shackle open. The spring loading in the
cylinder is so severe that even with the key it's hard to unlock. The pins feel
cheaply made. Just...terrible.

It's got five pins, all standard, and picking it is easy (aside from having to
deal with the spring loaded cylinder, which is loads of fun with a tension
wrench), and so is raking it, so...it's just really not a good lock. If you
want to have fun picking a lock...don't get this one.

## Master Lock Magnum

![Master Lock Magnum keyway](/assets/images/2022-04-24 17.07.56.jpg){: width="250" }
![Master Lock Magnum key](/assets/images/2022-12-12 18.29.23.jpg){: width="400" }

This is a considerably better lock from Master. Feels like a bit of a knockoff
of the Abus Titalium (and that's by no means an insult). Well built, five pins
with at least one spool and possibly one serrated pin. Pretty easy to SPP, as
long as you're relatively careful. Raking is hit-or-miss, mostly because of the
spool pin(s).

## Master Lock 532

![Master Lock 532](/assets/images/2022-12-12 18.38.41.jpg){: width="250" } ![Master Lock 532 key](/assets/images/2022-12-12 18.39.26.jpg){: width="400" }

Another lock from Master, pretty nice, but I'm not sure why this is considered
harder to pick than, say, the Magnum. It's only got 4 standard pins, so picking
it's pretty easy. The only challenge with this one is the bitting - see the
key? That last pin, there at the end of the key, is significantly higher than
the others, which means it's really easy, in SPP, to overset the pin ahead of
it when you're going for that pin. It also makes raking difficult (but not
impossible). Anyway, a pretty nice lock, but I'd rate it less difficult than
the Magnum, not more so.

## Brinks 40mm

![Brinks 40mm](/assets/images/2022-12-12 18.58.55.jpg){: width="250" } ![Brinks 40mm key](/assets/images/2022-12-12 18.59.34.jpg){: width="400" }

Another hardware store purchase - four pins with one spool and at least one
(what feels like) serrated pin. SPP's nicely, and also pretty easy to rake,
probably because of the even pinning depth.

## Brinks 50mm

![Brinks 50mm](/assets/images/2022-12-12 19.03.54.jpg){: width="250" } ![Brinks 50mm key](/assets/images/2022-12-12 19.04.24.jpg){: width="400" }

Yet another hardware store purchase - four standard pins. Easy-peasy.

## Ace Hardware 40mm

![Ace Hardware 40mm](/assets/images/2022-12-12 18.50.55.jpg){: width="250" } ![Ace Hardware 40mm key](/assets/images/2022-12-12 18.51.18.jpg){: width="400" }

This is a little guy I picked up from my local hardware store. Really nice lock
for the price, much better construction than the Master 140 or #3. Four pins
with at least two spool pins. The action is very clean, and SPP is a
little tricky because of the spools and because, at least with mine, the pin
depths are all over the place. Raking's difficult because of the spool pin
and the different pin depths - can't use anything more severe than a snake
without the pick getting stuck in the lock. Spring loaded like the Master #3.

## Commando Laminated

![Commando Laminated](/assets/images/2022-12-12 22.12.13.jpg){: width="250" } ![Commando Laminated key](/assets/images/2022-12-12 22.12.27.jpg){: width="400" }

This is such a weird lock - in a good way! Six pins, one spool, but...it just
feels different than any other lock I've picked. There's also no spring loading
in the cylinder, so when you unlock it, it stays unlocked until you turn the
key back. Also, in the unlocked position, the shackle moves freely, but if you
lock it without the shackle closed, it locks into the open position. I don't
know, I just find it interesting, a completely different design.

## Abus Titalium 80TI/50

![Abus Titalium 80TI/50](/assets/images/2022-12-12 22.08.20.jpg){: width="250" } ![Abus Titalium key](/assets/images/2022-12-12 22.08.25.jpg){: width="400" }

This is an amazing lock. Six pins, couple of spools, so the pins themselves are
nothing problematic, but...it's just engineered so well, and the tolerances are
so fine that you have to be very careful, paying attention all the time, to
avoid oversetting pins, and to maybe miss a pin and end up in
an endless loop of setting one, then another, and the first one drops again. I
love this lock, the feel of it as you're picking it, it really feels like
you're using a well-engineered piece of equipment. Never been able to rake it
open.

## American Lock 1100

![American Lock 1100](/assets/images/2022-12-12 22.30.10.jpg){: width="250" }
![American Lock 1100 keyway](/assets/images/2022-12-12 22.30.20.jpg){: width="250" }
![American Lock 1100 key](/assets/images/2022-12-12 22.30.26.jpg){: width="400" }

Oh, man, this one's a bear! Five pins, with four of them heavily serrated, and
the fifth one's a spool to boot! Easier with TOK, since that first pin is low,
so getting past it with BOK is tough, but finally worked it out and am able to
open it with BOK. I just got this a couple weeks ago, and it takes a lot of
very careful work to get it picked. Haven't even tried raking it yet. Soooo
much fun!

The core's removable, so one of these days I'll gut it and show the pins. What a monster!

# Door Locks

Door locks (with some notable exceptions) tend to be easier than padlocks,
probably because picking is somewhat less of a danger (since you can usually
get in through another way, e.g. a window). There are exceptions, however -
I've got a Medeco lock in my drawer that is calling my name, but I'm waiting
until I get a better lock vise before I try to scale that particular peak.

In my experience, door locks require a different feel than padlocks. Padlocks
tend to have fairly small keyways, and are engieered well. Door locks, on the
other hand, tend to have relatively large keyways, and also tend to have not as
nice a feel as padlocks, so they require a good bit more attention to see where
the pins are actually setting.

## Kwikset

![Kwikset door lock](/assets/images/2022-04-24 17.45.13.jpg){: width="250" }
![Kwikset door lock picked](/assets/images/2022-04-24 18.11.58.jpg){: width="250" }
![Kwikset door key](/assets/images/2022-12-13 17.47.42.jpg){: width="250" }

This is a generic Kwikset front door lock. Five pins, a couple of spool pins.
It has this sort of "crunchy" when I lift, and an actual sort of crunchy sound,
which is annoying.

## Schlage

![Schlage door lock](/assets/images/2022-04-24 18.12.57.jpg){: width="250" }
![Schlage door lock picked](/assets/images/2022-04-24 18.38.33.jpg){: width="250" }
![Schlage door key](/assets/images/2022-12-13 17.48.03.jpg){: width="250" }

Generic Schlage front door lock. A little nicer and more challenging than the
Kwikset. Five pins, a couple of spools, but the action is smoother than the
Kwikset. One annoying thing - that extra-high pin at the front of the lock (the
rear of the key)? With my little hook 1 pick, sooo easy to slip off the pin
because you have to lift it through such a huge angle. Sometimes I switch to a
longer hook just to avoid that. Ugh.
